I've added a private github repository, where you can get changes faster and track development
process. Send me an e-mail or a PM, and I'll send you an invitation

* Breaking Changes:

Command line arguments:
-bmStartDedicated -> -bmStartManual
-bmStartUserCreated -> -bmStartSpawned ("user created" made sense originally, but not anymore)
-bmInstanceId -> -bmSpawnId

* Other Changes:
New Feature: Spawner Inspector
New Feature: MongoDB support
New Feature: Logs wrapper for improved logging (just a first step towards proper logging)
Improvement: MessageHelper.Create now accepts uNet messages (extensions of BaseMessage) - this means you can reek some of the benefits of automatic serialization, provided by uNet
Improvement: IIncommingMessage.DeserializeMessage<BaseMessage type>() - deserializes uNet messages
Bug Fix: EndianBinaryWriter string serialization fix*
Bug Fix: Lobby map names are visible in the games list
Improvement: Added more control for giving out accesses to game servers:
   Added a new method to the interface IGameServer - ValidateAccessRequest - this will be called before giving an access to a user who requests it. Useful to do some custom checking for bans or other rules you might need
   Added a new method to the interface IGameServer - FillAccessProperties - useful, in case you want to attach extra data to the access before sending it to the player
Improvement: Spawner Queue sizes can now be changed via SpawnersModule - spawner queue is there to make sure people don't wait too long on a relatively busy server
Improvement: RSA key size - can be changed via static BmSecurity.RsaKeySize field
Improvement: Guest login can now be disabled via field AuthModule.EnableGuestLogin (inspector)
Improvement: Added two methods to IObservableProperty - SerializeToString and DeserializeFromString - these can be used when writing custom database implementations, so that you can save data in human-readable formats (previously it was just binary)

And a bunch of other things I forgot to note
